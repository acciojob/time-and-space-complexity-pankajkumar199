	<h1> understanding , Time, Space, Complexity </h1>

	<p>  Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of its input size. 
        A lower time complexity generally means the algorithm is more efficient.      </p>


	<p>     <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total memory used by an algorithm, including input values, variables, and function calls. 
        For example, an algorithm with Space Complexity of O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with input size.</p>
